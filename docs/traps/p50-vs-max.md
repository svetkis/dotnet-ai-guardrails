# Trap: P50 vs Max — "Average Temperature in the Hospital"

## Scenario

The agent makes a perf commit and writes: "p99 latency: 2727ms → 209ms (13x improvement)". A beautiful number. But:

- **P50 = experience of a typical user** (median request)
- **Max = experience of the most unlucky user** (worst case)
- **P99 = 1% of users get THIS**

A query that "on average" responds in 6ms can hang for 4.4 seconds. The agent optimizes P50, but tail latency remains catastrophic.

## Data from Practice

### Before Optimization (Spike test)

| Metric | Global | view_profile | view_slots |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **P50** | 5.94ms | 0.28ms | 5.4ms |
| **P99** | 1625ms | 868ms | 818ms |
| **Max** | **4400ms** | **3375ms** | **1667ms** |
| **P50→Max** | **741x** | **12057x** | **308x** |

**view_profile:** P50 = 0.28ms (lightning fast!), Max = 3375ms (3.4 seconds). Difference of **12 thousand times**.

### After Optimization (projections + ExecuteUpdateAsync)

| Metric | Global | view_profile | view_slots |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **P50** | 0.48ms | 0.26ms | 0.18ms |
| **P99** | 24ms | 15ms | 9.9ms |
| **Max** | **157ms** | **135ms** | **101ms** |

### Comparison

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| P50 | 5.94ms | 0.48ms | 12x |
| P99 | 1625ms | 24ms | **67x** |
| Max | 4400ms | 157ms | **28x** |

**Key:** P50 improved 12x, while P99 improved 67x. Tail latency is a different world.

## Why This Is Dangerous

The agent shows beautiful P50/P99, but:
- The user can hit tail latency
- Concurrent access (booking attack) shows different behavior
- Read-path optimization can break write-path (see `docs/traps/silent-breakdown.md`)

## Patterns from the Data

### 1. Divergence Grows with Load

| Scenario | RPS | P50→Max |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Baseline | 5 | 20x |
| Peak | 30 | 49x |
| Stress | 50→300 | 261x |
| Spike (before optimization) | burst 300 | **741x** |

### 2. view_profile — Always the Most Problematic

Reason: `.Include()` chains loaded workspace + subscriptions + categories + services. After replacing with `.Select()` projections — Max dropped from 3375ms to 135ms.

### 3. Write-path Is More Stable Than Read-path

`create_booking` shows less divergence (8-11x). The unique index makes the query predictable — either INSERT or 409 Conflict.

## Solution

1. **NBomber scenarios** — always look at $Max$, not just P50/P99
2. **Read + Write mix** — run both paths under load simultaneously
3. **Concurrent booking attack** — check race conditions under load
4. **AGENTS.md rule:** after a perf commit — check write-path and Max latency
