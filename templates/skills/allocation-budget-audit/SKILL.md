description: >
  Audit of allocation regressions in critical (hot path) methods. Checks that the
  agent did not add allocations to latency-sensitive code, and that every
  hot path method has a paired allocation test.

# Allocation Budget Audit — Skill

## Portable core

- Every method on a critical path must have a recorded allocation budget and a test that enforces it.
- New code must not exceed the budget without explicit rationale and repeated measurement.
- Measurements must be repeatable: environment, runtime, GC mode, and regression threshold are fixed.

## Requires adaptation

- Hot path marker: `[HotPath]`, `// HOTPATH`, a registry, etc.
- Measurement mechanism: `GC.GetAllocatedBytesForCurrentThread`, BenchmarkDotNet, custom harness.
- Regression threshold: baseline + N%, fixed limit, percentile.
- Language / runtime: .NET, JVM, Go, native, etc.

## Not applicable when

- The project has no latency-sensitive paths.
- Stable measurements are impossible (e.g., shared CI runners with high variance).

## Role

You are a performance engineer. Your task is to catch allocation regressions in
methods marked as hot paths before they reach production. You do not replace a
profiler; you build a fast guardrail: every hot path has an allocation budget,
and new code must not exceed it.

## Adaptation for Project

- **No hot path methods** → Won't do, document it.
- **Hot path attribute / marker exists** → every marked method must have an
  allocation test or equivalent guardrail.
- **Critical path without a marker** → introduce a hot path marker and inventory it.
- **Runtime without per-thread allocation API** → use available API carefully and document measurement error.

## Audit Rules

### 1. Hot path inventory
- [ ] All methods with a hot path marker are found (via reflection, static analysis, or registry).
- [ ] Every hot path has an allocation test or equivalent guardrail.
- [ ] Hot path marker is not used for helper / rare operations.

### 2. Allocation budget
- [ ] A baseline allocation budget is recorded for every hot path.
- [ ] Regression threshold is defined (e.g., baseline + 10% or a project-specific limit).
- [ ] Tests use warmup + multiple iterations for stability.
- [ ] Tests run in CI on relevant hardware / OS.

### 3. Regressions
- [ ] Methods exceeding the budget are reviewed manually.
- [ ] The reason for the regression is documented: boxing, async state machine,
  closures, LINQ allocations, etc.
- [ ] The fix is confirmed by a repeated measurement.

### 4. Compile-time guardrail
- [ ] If the project has a custom analyzer for hot paths (Roslyn, linter, AST analysis), it catches forbidden patterns at compile time.
- [ ] The analyzer has its own unit tests.

## Project-specific examples

> The examples below illustrate application in a .NET stack. Replace with your runtime and tools.

### Example: .NET + `[HotPath]` + `GC.GetAllocatedBytesForCurrentThread`

- **Marker:** `[HotPath]` attribute.
- **Test:** `{MethodName}_AllocationBudget`.
- **Analyzer:** `HotPathAnalyzer` catches `new` / `async` / boxing inside `[HotPath]` at compile time.
- **Analyzer tests:** see `tests/patterns/AnalyzerTests.cs` in the methodology repository.

## Report Format

```markdown
## Allocation Budget Audit — {date}

### Summary
| Method | Baseline (bytes) | Current (bytes) | Delta | Status |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| GetHotPathData | 1024 | 1150 | +12% | 🔴 FAIL |
| GetDayTimeline | 512 | 510 | -0.4% | 🟢 OK |

### Regressions
- [ ] [CERTAIN] `{File}:{Line}` — `{Method}`: +{N}% because of {reason} → {fix}

### Missing budget tests
- [ ] [CERTAIN] `{Method}` does not have an allocation test
```

## ANTI-HALLUCINATION Protocol

Every finding MUST include:
1. **Exact file and line:** `src/Infrastructure/EntityQueryService.cs:88`
2. **Code quote:** 3–5 lines showing the added allocation
3. **Baseline/current values:** baseline 1024 bytes, current 1150 bytes
4. **Reason:** boxing in LINQ, async state machine, closure, etc.
5. **Measurement details:** iteration count, GC mode, OS/runtime

**NEVER report:**
- “The method is slow” without measurements
- “Needs optimization” without a concrete bottleneck
- Problems not confirmed by a repeatable measurement

## Severity Levels

- **BLOCKER** — budget exceeded by more than 50% on a critical hot path.
- **CRITICAL** — budget exceeded by 10–50% on a hot path.
- **MAJOR** — missing allocation test for a hot path method.
- **MINOR** — fluctuation within measurement noise.

## Confidence Level

- **CERTAIN** — repeated measurement on the same hardware / OS / runtime shows a
  stable budget regression.
- **REVIEW** — only one measurement, or the delta is within 5–10%. Needs rerun.

## Integration

**Input from:** Load Tests, Performance Audit, compile-time guardrail for hot paths.
**Output to:** Backlog Hygiene Agent, Programmer Agent (optimization),
Architecture Tests (ratchet update).
