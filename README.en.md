# .NET Skeptical AI Engineering

AI-accelerated quality control methodology for .NET teams. Extending DORA practices: if AI can assist review, it can scale audits, load testing, and architecture guardrails too. Based on the talk "AI is confident. I am not" (Dotnext 2026).

> Although examples and tests are implemented in .NET, the methodology itself — Decision Guards, Engineering Assurance Levels, and prompt hygiene — applies to any stack.

This repository contains ready-made artifacts for .NET projects: rules, skills, test patterns, and CI workflows.

## Problem

AI agents (Cursor, Claude, Copilot) speed up code writing, but generate hidden tech debt, violate architectural boundaries, and break security. Manual review of such code becomes a bottleneck.

**Skeptical AI** is a Zero-Trust methodology for generated code. Control moves from probabilistic prompts into deterministic pipelines.

## How it works

The control model is **Engineering Assurance Levels**. An artifact is classified by
what it verifies, not by where it runs: a unit test does not become a System Check
just because it runs in CI.

| Level | When it triggers | What it includes | Key question |
|-------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Control Foundation** | Before code changes | `AGENTS.md`, architecture boundaries, Decision Guards, policies | Which constraints and decisions are already made? |
| **1. Change Checks** | IDE, build, pre-commit | Compiler, nullable, analyzers, formatting, banned APIs, dependency checks, pre-commit review | Can the change technically exist? |
| **2. Behavior Checks** | Local or CI test run | Unit, regression, contract, characterization, architecture tests, ratchets | Are expected properties and behavior preserved? |
| **3. System Checks** | PR, CI, release pipeline | Integration, E2E, smoke, Testcontainers, load (NBomber), deployment verification | Does the system work as a whole? |
| **4. Periodic Assurance** | On schedule or risk-trigger | Security, database, performance, UX, API, i18n, tech-debt audits | Which systemic risks are invisible to automated checks? |

Separate processes, not levels:

- **Engineering Governance** — residual risk acceptance, release decision, business and product decisions.
- **Control Maintenance** — keeping instructions, agent memory, backlog, baselines, suppressions, and guardrails themselves up to date (skills `memory-hygiene`, `doc-hygiene`, `backlog-hygiene`).

> **Legacy:** `PYRAMID.en.md` (layers 0–2 + outer loop) is the talk's visual metaphor.
> The canonical classifier is the table above; the layer-to-level mapping is given at
> the top of [`PYRAMID.en.md`](PYRAMID.en.md).

### Artifact map by level

| Level / process | Repository artifacts |
|-----------------|----------------------|

| 1. Change Checks | Banned APIs, Roslyn analyzers (`examples/DemoProject/src/DemoProject.Analyzers/`), `ci/github-actions/safe-ci.yml`, `templates/skills/code-review/`, `templates/skills/frontend-code-review/`, `templates/skills/task-compliance/` |
| 2. Behavior Checks | `tests/patterns/` (Ratchet, NetArchTest, Snapshot, Analyzer tests), `tests/conventions/` |
| 3. System Checks | E2E/smoke patterns, NBomber (`tests/patterns/LoadTest.cs`) |
| 4. Periodic Assurance | `templates/skills/*-audit/` (security, dba, performance, api-design, bot, i18n, tech-debt, simplicity, complexity, version, test, mutation, spellcheck, business-risk) |
| Control Maintenance | `templates/skills/memory-hygiene/`, `doc-hygiene/`, `backlog-hygiene/` |
| Engineering Governance | `docs/solutions/human-audit-bridge.md`, release decision |

`templates/skills/` — ready-made instructions for audits. Run on schedule or when code changes in their area.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/svetkis/dotnet-ai-guardrails.git

# 2. Run DemoProject
cd examples/DemoProject
dotnet build
dotnet run --project tests/DemoProject.Tests

# 3. Assess your project
# Open .agents/skills/skeptical-ai-bootstrap/SKILL.md and run the checklist —
# figure out what you already have and what to implement first.

# 4. Adapt skills to your stack
# See templates/skills/ADAPTATION.md — cross out irrelevant checks.

# 5. Copy needed artifacts
cp rules/AGENTS_TEMPLATE.md /your/project/
cp -r templates/skills/code-review /your/project/.kimi/skills/
# For React/TypeScript frontend:
# cp -r templates/skills/frontend-code-review /your/project/.kimi/skills/
cp tests/patterns/*.cs /your/project/tests/
```

```

## DemoProject

`examples/DemoProject/` is a working .NET 10 example with all patterns:

- Clean Architecture (Domain → Application → Infrastructure)
- NetArchTest: layer dependency checks
- Ratchet tests: public type and test count control
- Snapshot tests: JSON serialization contracts
- NBomber: load tests (read + write mix)
- TUnit: run via `dotnet run --project`

```bash
cd examples/DemoProject
dotnet build
dotnet run --project tests/DemoProject.Tests
```

## DemoProject.Traps

`examples/DemoProject.Traps/` — intentionally broken code demonstrating guardrails in action. Every test here fails, showing what an architectural test catches when an agent violates the rules.

```bash
cd examples/DemoProject.Traps
dotnet run --project tests/DemoProject.Traps.Tests
```

**What breaks:**
- `MutableState` — mutable state in Domain
- `DomainLeakingToInfra` — Domain depends on `System.Net.Http`
- `PaymentService` — direct dependency between Features (Orders → Payments)
- `Modules/` — cyclic dependencies between modules (ArchUnitNET)
- `RawGuidEntity` — raw `Guid` instead of strongly typed ID

See also [`examples/DemoProject.Traps/README.md`](examples/DemoProject.Traps/README.md).

## DemoProject.MinimalApi

`examples/DemoProject.MinimalApi/` — a variant for **Minimal API without Clean Architecture**. Shows how to adapt guardrails when there are no Domain / Application / Infrastructure layers.

```bash
cd examples/DemoProject.MinimalApi
dotnet build
dotnet run --project tests/DemoProject.MinimalApi.Tests
```

**What's inside:**
- Naming conventions, banned APIs (`DateTime.Now`)
- `CancellationToken` guard
- Ratchet tests for public types
- Duplication guard for business logic

See also [`examples/DemoProject.MinimalApi/README.md`](examples/DemoProject.MinimalApi/README.md).
